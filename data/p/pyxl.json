    "description": "Pyxl is an open source package that extends Python to support inline HTML. It converts\n        HTML fragments into valid Python expressions, and is meant as a replacement for traditional\n        python templating systems like Mako or Cheetah. It automatically escapes data, enforces\n        correct markup and makes it easier to write reusable and well structured UI code.\n        Pyxl was inspired by the XHP project at Facebook",
