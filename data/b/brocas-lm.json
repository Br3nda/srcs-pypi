    "description": "Broca's LM is a free python library providing a probabilistic language model based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). It utilizes Gensim's Word2Vec implementation to transform input word sequences into a dense vector space. The output of the model is a seqeuence of probability distributions across the given vocabulary",
